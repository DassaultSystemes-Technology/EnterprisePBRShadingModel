The Enterprise PBR Shading Model (DSPBR) is a material optimized for performance in realtime scenarios in a rasterizer. It is inspired by the Disney Principled BRDF [#Bur12] [#Bur15] and the Unreal Shading Model [#Kar13]. Although it is primarily targeted at performance, it must still be possible to render the model without any difficulties in a GI renderer, as it is also the basis for cross-renderer consistency.

The model consists of a core part and additional effects. Renderers must implement all effects in order to be consistent, but may choose to compile spezialized shaders if an effect is disabled.

Components
==========

Core
----

At its core, the Enterprise PBR Shading Model consists of three BSDFs which are combined in such a way that it is possible to model a large amount of real-world materials, both dielectrics (transparent and opaque) and conductors. Users can adjust parameters to continuously mix between the models.

The material can operate in two modes: it can simulate an infinitely thin, two-sided object or a volume boundary. In the latter case, the material has to be attached to a closed mesh, i.e., the mesh encloses a volume and does not have any holes. The parameters of the volume extension (Section [Volume]) describe what happens inside the volume.

The model is a sum of a diffuse, a reflective and a transmissive component:

\begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) = f_d(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) + f_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) + f_t(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l})
\end{equation}

The BSDFs are defined in the following way:

\begin{eqnarray}
f_d(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \frac{\rho_d}{\pi} B(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{l}) \\
f_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& M_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) F(\mathbf{h}_r \cdot \mathbf{v}) + C_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l})\\
f_t(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \rho_t M_t(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}') (1 - F(\mathbf{h}_t \cdot \mathbf{v}))
\end{eqnarray}

with $\mathbf{h}_r = \frac{\mathbf{l} + \mathbf{v}}{\lVert\mathbf{l} + \mathbf{v}\rVert}$, $\mathbf{h}_t = \frac{\mathbf{l'} + \mathbf{v}}{\lVert\mathbf{l'} + \mathbf{v}\rVert}$ and $\mathbf{l}' = \mathbf{l} + 2 \mathbf{n} (-\mathbf{l} \cdot \mathbf{n})$ to flip the light direction from lower to upper hemisphere in order to be able to reuse the microfacet reflection function for transmission.

### Reflection and Transmission Components

Reflection and transmission are based on microfacet BSDFs [#Wal07]. An additional energy compensation term $C_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l})$ for reflection makes the microfacet BRDF energy preserving by approximating the energy from multiple scattering between microfacets, an effect that gets stronger the higher the roughness of the surface is.

The roughness $(\alpha_u, \alpha_v)$ is squared to make it perceptually more linear. The index of refraction of the media on the incident and transmitted side of the surface is denoted by $\eta_i$ and $\eta_t$, respectively.

\begin{eqnarray}
M_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \frac{D(\mathbf{h},\alpha_u^2,\alpha_v^2) G(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l},\alpha_u^2,\alpha_v^2)}{4 (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}) (\mathbf{l} \cdot \mathbf{n})}\\
M_t(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=&
\begin{cases}
M_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) & \text{if thin-walled} \\
\frac{|\mathbf{l} \cdot \mathbf{h}_t| |\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{h}_t|}{|\mathbf{l} \cdot \mathbf{n}| |\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}|} \frac{\eta_t^2 D(\mathbf{h}_t,\alpha_u^2,\alpha_v^2) G(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l},\alpha_u^2,\alpha_v^2)}{\eta_i(\mathbf{l} \cdot \mathbf{h}_t) + (\eta_t(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{h}_t))^2} & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

To allow for anisotropic materials we derive roughnesses in tangent ($\alpha_u$) and bitangent ($\alpha_v$) direction from the isotropic roughness $\alpha$ and anisotropy strength $o$. In addition we support anisotropy rotation by rotating the local tangent space counter-clockwise around the normal with the anisotropy rotation parameter $\beta$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}\alpha_u\\\alpha_v\end{pmatrix} = \alpha \begin{pmatrix}1\\1-o\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{t}_\text{rot} \\ \mathbf{b}_\text{rot} \\ \mathbf{n}_\text{rot}\end{pmatrix}^\top = \begin{pmatrix}\cos(2\pi\beta)\mathbf{t}+\sin(2\pi\beta)\mathbf{b} \\ -\sin(2\pi\beta)\mathbf{t}+\cos(2\pi\beta)\mathbf{b} \\ \mathbf{n}\end{pmatrix}^\top
\end{equation}

For performance reasons Schlick's Fresnel approximation is used. It is a lot easier to compute than the full Fresnel equations.

\begin{eqnarray}
F(\theta) &=&
\begin{cases}
\rho_{s,r,0} + (\rho_{s,r,90} - \rho_{s,r,0}) (1 - |\cos\theta|)^5 & \text{if }
\eta_t >= \eta_i
 \\
\rho_{s,r,0} + (\rho_{s,r,90} - \rho_{s,r,0}) (1 - |\cos\theta_t|)^5 & \text{if }
\eta_t < \eta_i \land \sin^2\theta_t < 1
 \\
1 & \text{if }
\eta_t < \eta_i \land \sin^2\theta_t >= 1 \text{ (total internal reflection)}
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

where $\theta_t$ is the angle of transmission, computed from the angle of incidence via $\sin^2\theta_t = \left(\frac{\eta_i}{\eta_t}\right)^2 (1 - \cos^2\theta_i)$ [#Lag13]. Note that in case of total internal reflection, the Fresnel does not depend on $\rho_{s,r,90}$ anymore, so it is impossible to disable the reflection in this situation. This allows users to change the specular component of a refractive object without introducing artifacts, i.e., dark appearance in areas where total internal reflection occurs.

For the microfacet distribution, the material uses the Generalized Trowbridge-Reitz GTR model (generalized anisotropic GGX) [#Bur12] with $\gamma=2$

\begin{eqnarray}
D(\mathbf{h},\alpha_x,\alpha_y) = \frac{1}{\pi \alpha_x \alpha_y} \frac{1}{\left(\frac{(\mathbf{h} \cdot \mathbf{x})^2}{\alpha_x^2}+\frac{(\mathbf{h} \cdot \mathbf{y})^2}{\alpha_y^2}+(\mathbf{h} \cdot \mathbf{n})^2\right)^2}
\end{eqnarray}

which corresponds to classic GGX in isotropic case $\alpha=\alpha_u=\alpha_v$:

\begin{eqnarray}
D(\mathbf{h},\alpha) = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\alpha^2}{((\mathbf{h} \cdot \mathbf{n})^2(\alpha^2-1)+1)^2}
\end{eqnarray}

#### Energy Preservation

The standard microfacet model does not account for scattering occuring between microfacets on the microsurface. As the surface becomes less specular, the multiple scattering becomes stronger, effectively resulting in high energy loss if this is not accounted for (see Figure [energycomp-microfacet-metallic]). [#KC17] describes a method based on [#Kel01] to approximate multiple scattering for microfacet models that can be adapted for real-time rendering.

![Figure [energycomp-microfacet-metallic]: Left: Metallic surface with roughness 0. Middle: Non-energy preserving metallic surface with roughness 1. Right: Energy-preserving metallic surface with roughness 1 by accounting for multiple scattering. Note that the surface in the middle looks significantly darker than the others.](img/energycomp_metallic.png)

Instead of a lookup table as in [#KC17], we use analytical fits for the energy compensation term $C_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l})$. This improves real-time performance as we do not need additional texture fetches.

\begin{eqnarray}
C_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \underbrace{\frac{(1-E_m(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n}))(1-E_m(\mathbf{l}\cdot\mathbf{n}))}{\pi(1-E_{m,avg})}}_{\text{Multiple scattering GGX}} \underbrace{\frac{{F_{m,avg}}^2 E_{m,avg}}{{1 - F_{m,avg}(1 - E_{m,avg})}}}_{\text{Multiple scattering Fresnel}}
\end{eqnarray}

We measured the directional albedo $E_m(\theta)$ and average albedo $E_{m,avg}$ by integrating the single-scattering GGX microfacet model as described in [#KC17]. The following functions approximate the measured data with reasonable performance-quality tradeoff:

\begin{eqnarray}
E_m(\theta) &=& 1 - 1.4594\alpha_{uv}\cos\theta \\
 &&* \left(-0.20277 + \alpha_{uv} (2.772 + \alpha_{uv} (-2.6175 + 0.73343 \alpha_{uv}))\right) \nonumber\\
 &&* \left(3.09507 + \cos\theta (-9.11369 + \cos\theta (15.8884 + \cos\theta (-13.70343 + 4.51786 \cos\theta)))\right) \nonumber\\
 \alpha_{uv} &=& \alpha_u \alpha_v \\
 \nonumber\\
E_{m,avg} &=& 1.0 + \alpha_{uv} (-0.113 + \alpha_{uv} (-1.8695 + \alpha_{uv} (2.2268 - 0.83397 \alpha_{uv})))
 \\
F_{m,avg} &=& 0.047619 \rho_{s,r,90} + 0.952381 \rho_{s,r,0}
\end{eqnarray}

Note that we convert from anisotropic to isotropic roughness $\alpha_{uv}$ to simplify the function.

Implementations may choose to replace the multiple scattering Fresnel part with the single scattering Fresnel $F(\theta)$ if concerned about performance.

### Diffuse Component

The diffuse contribution of the material is modeled with a simple Lambertian BRDF. Based on the amount of specular contribution from the microfacet components, the diffuse contribution needs to be multiplied with a directional-dependent factor to ensure energy conservation. Following the approach of [#Kel01] and [#KC17], the factor is calculated from the missing energy after specular reflection. Instead of a lookup table, we use an analytical fit to save expensive texture lookups. For more information see Section [Energy Compensation: Diffuse-Specular].

![Figure [energycomp-plastic]: Combination of diffuse and specular component with energy compensation for roughness 0 (left) and 1 (right). Note that the combination is energy-conserving (no energy is produced, even at multiple bounces inside the object) and energy-preserving (especially at grazing angles).](img/energycomp_plastic.png)

The diffuse BRDF looks as follows:

\begin{eqnarray}
B(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{l}) &=&
\begin{cases}
(1-s) + \frac{s(1-E(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n}))(1-E(\mathbf{l}\cdot\mathbf{n}))}{\pi(1-E_{avg})} & \ \\
 0 & \text{if total internal reflection wrt.} \mathbf{v} \text{ or }\mathbf{l}
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

The factor $s$ can be used to decrease the contribution of the microfacet model, as described in Section [Parameters]. When the microfacet model becomes darker, we blend the diffuse component to a constant Lambertian BRDF.

The directional albedo $E(\theta)$ and average albedo $E_{avg}$ are expensive to compute, as it involves integrating the Fresnel-weighted GGX microfacet model over all light directions on the hemisphere. The terms are approximated with the following formulas:

\begin{eqnarray}
E(\cos\theta) &=& \operatorname{lerp}(E_0 + (1.0 - E_0)(1 - \cos\theta)^5, 0.04762 + 0.95238 E_0, 1 - (1 - \alpha_{uv})^5) \\
E_{avg} &=& E_0 + (-0.33263 \alpha_{uv} - 0.072359) (1 - E_0) E_0
\end{eqnarray}

with $E_0 = F_0 s \rho_{s,\text{max}}$, where $\rho_{s,\text{max}}$ denotes the maximum value of the wavelength-dependent color $\rho_s$. The maximum is used because the color is subtracted, leading to unexpected behavior if this is done per channel. Section [Parameters] describes these parameters in more detail.

### Parameters

In order to simplify usage of the model and to ensure energy conservation, the weights $\rho_d$, $\rho_{s,r,0}$, $\rho_{s,r,90}$, and $\rho_t$ of the individual components of the model are not directly given by the user, but instead computed from a set of user parameters $\rho$, $\rho_s$, $m$, $t$, $s$ as follows:

\begin{eqnarray}
\rho_d &=& \rho (1-m) (1-t) \\
\rho_t &=& \rho (1-m) t \\
\rho_{s,r,0} &=& (1-m) F_0 s \rho_s + m \rho \\
\rho_{s,r,90} &=& (1-m) s + m \\
\end{eqnarray}

where $F_0 = \left(\frac{\eta_i - \eta_o}{\eta_i + \eta_o}\right)^2$.

Table [core-parameters] describes the user parameters in more detail. The parameters $s$, $m$ and $t$ make the model very flexible. Table [mst] shows a list of all available combinations and explains their meaning.

The basic workflow to configure a physically-plausible material involves three steps:

1. Choose the color $\rho$ of the material.
2. Choose the material type via $m$ and $t$.
3. Choose an IOR for the coating/refraction.

For more fine-grained artistic control, the material can now be tweaked even further:

4. Fine-tune amount of specular contribution via $s$.
5. Fine-tune specular color near $\theta=0^\circ$ via $\rho_s$.

Sheen
-----

This extension adds rim lighting (or sheen) resulting from both forward and backward scattering to the Enterprise PBR Shading Model, controlled by a single parameter $b$. This is useful for some fabrics like, for example, velvet.

\begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) = f'_d(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) + f_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) + f_t(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) + f_b(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l})
\end{equation}

The new component $f_b(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l})$ is mixed into the diffuse component of the core material, modifying $f_d(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l})$ accordingly:

\begin{eqnarray}
f'_d(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \frac{\rho'_d}{\pi} B(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{l}) \\
f_b(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \rho_b M_b(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) B(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{l})
\end{eqnarray}

Both components are weighted the same with regard to the Fresnel, making the retro-reflective component also part of the base layer. It uses the Ashikhmin BRDF with the "inverted Gaussian distribution" [#AP07] [#NP13].

\begin{eqnarray}
M_b(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \frac{D_{inv}(b,\mathbf{h})}{4 \left[(\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{l}) + (\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{v}) - (\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{l})(\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{v})\right]} \\
D_{inv}(b,\mathbf{h}) &=& \frac{1}{\pi (1 + 4b^2)} \left(1 + \frac{4 \exp\left(\frac{-\cot^2\theta_h}{b^2}\right)}{\sin^4\theta_h}\right)
\end{eqnarray}

$b$ controls the shape of the inverse Gaussian distribution and, therefore, could be considered as its roughness.

### Parameters

The mixing into the diffuse component is important to achieve energy conservation. The parameter $b$ is not only used to control the roughness of the Ashikhmin BRDF, but also to interpolate between the two BRDFs:

\begin{eqnarray}
\rho'_d &=& \rho (1-m) (1-t) \hat{b} \\
\rho_b &=& \rho (1-m) (1-t) (1-\hat{b})
\end{eqnarray}

The reason for reusing the parameter is the fact that the Ashikhmin BRDF looks almost like a Lambertian BRDF for small values of $b$. However, as this similarity quickly disappears, $b$ is not directly used as mixing weight, but instead $\hat{b}$ is derived from $b$ via $\hat{b} = (1-b)^5$.

Besides that, the retro-reflective component also makes use of the overall albedo of the material, it does not introduce another color. In effect that means that by increasing $b$, the color gets distributed to grazing angles, making the material appear darker if the incident angle is close to the surface normal.

In conclusion, the sheen effect introduces only one additional parameter to the material, shown in the following table.

 Name        | Type          | Default | Range  | Description
-------------|---------------|---------|--------|-------------
$b$          | float         | 0       | 0-1    | Sheen (0 = none, 1 = full).

Flakes
------

Some materials, such as car paint or grainy metals, exhibit shifting random patterns of bright sparkles or glints. These glints may suddenly appear or disappear if light or view direction changes. In car paints, for example, this phenomenon comes from small mirror-like flakes distributed in the material below its coating. This can be modeled with the flakes layer of the Enterprise PBR Shading Model.

### Overview

Our method is based on [#Jak14] and [#AK16] and some own ideas to make it perform well in a rasterizer setting. The common idea is to procedurally generate individual flakes instead of using a texture (e.g. a high resolution normal map). This reduces texture fetching by trading them for a bit of extra computation to generate the flake positions and orientations on the fly. Also the BRDF is not evaluated pointwise but instead is understood to return the integral over the whole pixel foot print (see Section 3.1 "Multiscale BRDFs" in [#Jak14]), thus allowing to efficiently account for the contribution of many flakes in one evaluation which results in positionally and temporally stable flakes without flickering.

For stable and efficient handling of flakes the method requires approximation of pixel footprint on the directly visible surface which can be given by position and two vectors defining parallogramm in 3D space. Once we have the pixel footprint we can convert it to texture space, build and iterate the full list of flake positions and directions within the footprint and calculates the final radiance.

Converting pixel footprint into texture space is done using triplanar mapping (for details see Section [Triplanar Mapping]). Additionally we also repeat the texture by wrapping coordinates of the footprint in [0, 1) range.

### Parameters

[Table [flakes-parameters]: List of flakes parameters]

![Figure [flakes-parameters-fig]: Result for various values of flakes parameters](img/params_flakes.png)

### BRDF Evaluation

Flakes are added to the base material using a weighted average of base and flakes layer. The flake coverage parameter controls the blending. Here the flake coverage parameter functions as a linear blend parameter (e.g. alpha) in a lerp between the base albedo $\rho$ and the flake color $\rho_s$.

\begin{eqnarray}
f_\text{flaky_base}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& f_\text{base}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) + f_\text{flakes}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) \\ \\
f_\text{base}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& f(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) \ (1 - s_d) \\
f_\text{flakes}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \rho_s M_s(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) s_d
\end{eqnarray}

The flake layer is an alpha blend between a stochastic flakes BRDF (see next section) and a smooth microfacet BRDF with the same roughness $\alpha_s$ and color $\rho_s$.

\begin{eqnarray}
M_s(\alpha_s,\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& (1-b)M_\text{stoch}(\alpha_s, \mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) + b\, M_\text{smooth}(\alpha_s, \mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) \\
M_\text{smooth}(\alpha_s,\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \frac{ D(\alpha_s, \mathbf{h}) G(\alpha_s, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{l})}{4 (\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n})(\mathbf{l}\cdot\mathbf{n}) } \\
b &=& \text{smoothstep}\left(\frac{N_\text{exp}-\text{blend_min}}{\text{blend_max}-\text{blend_min}}\right) \\
N_\text{exp} &=& A_\text{footprint} N \\
A_\text{footprint} &=& \lVert\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}\rVert \\
\text{smoothstep}(x) &=& y^2(3-2y) \quad \text{where}\quad y=\text{clamp}(x,0,1)
\end{eqnarray}

Here $A_\text{footprint}$ is the area of the pixel footprint (parallelogram) in texture space and $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}$ are its base vectors. $\mathbf{h}$ is the regular half vector $\left(=\left(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{l}\right) / \left\Vert\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{l}\right\Vert\right)$.

$M_\text{smooth}$ is the Cook-Torrance microfacet BRDF with the Fresnel term set to one.

In the limit of high number of flakes the stochastic flakes BRDF should match the smooth microfacet BRDF. For performance reasons we evaluate only the smooth microfacet model when the number of expected flakes in the footprint $N_\text{exp}$ exceeds an internal fixed parameter $\text{blend_max}$. How this should be set depends on the hardware to guarantee best performance, but we had good results setting it to 64. $\text{blend_min}=1$. When $N_\text{exp}$ lies between $\text{blend_min}$ and $\text{blend_max}$ we return a blended mix between the stochastic flakes and the smooth microfacet BRDF. When $N_\text{exp}$ is below $\text{blend_min}$ we only evaluate the stochastic flakes BRDF.

### Stochastic Flake BRDF Evaluation

In accordance to [#Jak14] Section 3.1 the model is a Cook Torrance microfacet BRDF with two modifications. Instead of a smooth normal distribution function, the distribution function consists of a sum of procedurally generated flakes with specific positions and orientations, that have a nearly specular appearance, approximated by a cone BRDF. Secondly in the model the BRDF is integrated over the pixel footprint in texture space and over solid angle inside a cone around the light vector with a fixed low cone angle (we found $\gamma=7$ degree to be a good value), meaning that all flakes inside the pixel footprint whose orientation is close to the halfvector contribute to the result. In [#Jak14] this is called a multiscale BRDF, in contrast to a regular BRDF evaluated pointwise in texture and orientation space, which could only catch a single flake at maximum at each evaluation. The formula of the resulting multiscale BRDF we use in accordance to ([#Jak14], 3.1, formula (5)+(6)) is

\begin{eqnarray}
M_\text{stoch}(\alpha_s,\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \frac{ (\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{h}) \hat{D}(A,\Omega_h) G(\alpha_s, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{l})}{A_\text{footprint} N*2\pi(1-\cos(\gamma)) (\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n})(\mathbf{l}\cdot\mathbf{n}) } \\
\hat{D}(A,\Omega_h) &=& \sum_{k=1}^N \mathbf{1}_{\Omega_h}(\mathbf{h}^k)\mathbf{1}_A(\mathbf{p}^k)
\end{eqnarray}

where $\mathbf{1}_A(\mathbf{p}^k)$ and $\mathbf{1}_{\Omega_h}(\mathbf{h}^k)$ are indicator functions, which are one when the $k$-th flake position is inside the pixel footprint and the $k$-th flake is oriented so that the reflected view direction is inside a cone with opening angle $2\gamma$. In effect the sum is counting the flakes which are in the footprint and oriented so that view reflects to the light direction within $\gamma$ degrees. $G(\alpha_s, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{l})$ is the microfacet shadowing masking function (we use height correlated Smith). Compared to the classic Cook Torrance microfacet formula we omit the Fresnel term for simplicity and we gain a factor of $4(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{\omega}_h)$ to account for the change of variables from half vector direction to light direction in $\hat{D}(A,\Omega_h)$. Additionally we have three normalization factors in the denominator in the form of the pixel footprint area $A_\text{footprint}$, the total number of flakes $N$ and the cone solid angle $2\pi(1-\cos(\gamma))$ that are introduced by the multiscale BRDF integration over pixel footprint and solid angle in a cone around the light direction. $A_\text{footprint} N$ together can also be interpreted as the expected number of flakes inside the pixel footprint, which is needed in other parts as well.

### Flake Generation

To procedurally generate the flake positions we deviate from previous approaches (traversing a 4D structure and a multinomial stochastic process to distribute the flakes in [#Jak14] or traversing a quad tree with a normal approximation to a multinomial distribution for the flake count in [#AK16]) and use a much easier method that is well suited for the rasterizer:

First we compute the number of flakes per area (in texture uv space assuming $1m^2$ for the unit square) as

\begin{equation}
N = \frac{s_d}{s_s^2}
\end{equation}

and then we distribute the $N$ flakes in a stratified grid over the texture space so that each grid cell contains the same (small) number of flakes (currently we use $N_\text{cell} = 4$ flakes per grid cell). This results in a grid resolution of

\begin{equation}
\text{seed_res} = \text{max}\left(4,  \left \lfloor \sqrt{ \frac{N}{N_\text{cell}} } \right \rfloor \right)
\end{equation}

which can be seen as the (virtual) seed texture resolution (the `max(4,...)` construct is there to make sure we don't hit zero resolution, the 4 is arbitrarily chosen).
We use the [Tiny Encryption Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm) with six rounds as a hash function (see Section [TEA] for more information) to generate a random number generator seed for a linear congruential generator with the parameters

\begin{eqnarray}
r_0 &=& \text{TEA}((i+\text{seed_res})\;\text{mod}\;\text{seed_res}, (j+\text{seed_res})\;\text{mod}\;\text{seed_res}) \\
r_{n+1} &\equiv& 1103515245 r_n + 12345 \quad(\text{mod}\; 2^{32})
\end{eqnarray}

Here we give seed pixel coordinates $i,j$ modulo seed_res to our hash functions to make the flake texture consistent w.r.t. uv space wrap around. The added offset of seed_res makes sure that we don't have to take modulo of a negative number, which in general would resultin a wrong wrap around behaviour (modulo of the unsigned twos complement instead of integers decreasing with steps of one).

From the generated seed $r_0 = 4$ we generate four uniform random float numbers $u_{1...4}\in[0,1]$ per flake which are then used to generate the flake position and orientations.

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{p}^k &=& \frac{1}{\text{seed_res}}\left(\begin{pmatrix}i\\j\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}u^k_1\\u^k_2\end{pmatrix}\right) \\
\mathbf{h}^k &=& \text{ggx_sample}(\mathbf{v}=(0,0,1), \alpha_s, \begin{pmatrix}u^k_3\\u^k_4\end{pmatrix})
\end{eqnarray}

where $i,j$ are the current (integer) row/column indices in the seed grid, which *can go outside the usual* $i,j\in\{0,1,\ldots,\text{seed_res}-1\}$ case, because pixel footprint parallelograms can protrude outside the seed pixel rectangle from their starting point. For the case of computing flake positions and later checking if they are inside of the pixel footprint they *should not be wrapped or clamped*. This makes the parallelogram test easier and avoids artifacts at the borders. $k\in\{0,1,\ldots,N_\text{cell}-1\}$ is the index for the current flake in the cell and $\mathbf{p}^k$, $\mathbf{h}^k$ are the $k$-th flake position and orientation, respectively. The orientations are sampled from a smooth microfacet normal distribution function, in our case GGX.

### Counting Contributing Flakes

Because we want to know which flakes are within the pixel foot print, it is necessary to calculate which grid cells are actually intersected by the pixel footprint first. Flake positions for those grid cells which are partially intersected by the footprint need to be checked explicitly against parallelogram. Those flakes inside a grid cell, which is fully contained by the footprint, don't require this extra check. For both checks we use the *unclamped* and *unwrapped* flake positions, which can go outside the original $u\in(0,1) \wedge v\in(0,1)$ uv-space. This makes the following parallelogram test easier and avoids border artifacts. Finally we generate the reflection direction for all the flakes within the paralellogram and count flakes which are within cone around light direction.

\begin{eqnarray}
  \mathbf{1}_A(\mathbf{p}^k) &=& \begin{cases} 1 & \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\end{pmatrix}\leq\begin{pmatrix}u_x&v_x\\u_y&v_y\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}p_x^k-f_x\\p_y^k-f_y\end{pmatrix} \leq \begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \\
  \mathbf{1}_{\Omega_h}(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{l}, \mathbf{h}^k) &=& \begin{cases} 1 & \text{dot}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{l}) > \cos(\gamma) \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \quad \text{where} \quad \mathbf{r}=2 \text{dot}(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{h}^k) \mathbf{h}^k - \mathbf{v}
\end{eqnarray}

where $\mathbf{f},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}$ are the origin and two vectors which span the footprint parallelogram and $\mathbf{p}^k$ is the $k$-th flake position in texture space. Since flakes only contribute when they pass both checks (inside footprint and inside cone), we can exchange the order of the checks, which can benefit performance, because the cone test might be less costly than testing against the footprint. We recommend to use rasterization (e.g scan line fill algorithm) to efficiently determine grid cells which are partially or fully intersected with parallelogram.

Clearcoat
---------

The clearcoat extension adds a dielectric coating as a layer on top of the Enterprise PBR Shading Model. The base material $f(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l})$ and the coating layer are weighted with a Fresnel term. The parameter $c$ determines the strength of the effect.

\begin{eqnarray}
f_{coated}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& f_\text{flaky_base}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) + f_{coating}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) \\ \nonumber\\
f_\text{flaky_base}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& f(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) (1 - c \ \max(F_c(\mathbf{n}_c \cdot \mathbf{v}), F_c(\mathbf{n}_c \cdot \mathbf{l})) \\
f_{coating}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& M_c(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) \ c \ F_c(\mathbf{h} \cdot \mathbf{v})
\end{eqnarray}

The coating is based on a microfacet BRDF with an isotropic GGX distribution and squared roughness, similar to the reflection component in the core material.

\begin{eqnarray}
M_c(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \frac{D(\mathbf{h},\alpha_c^2) G(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l})}{4 (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}_c) (\mathbf{l} \cdot \mathbf{n}_c)}
\end{eqnarray}

The index of refraction in Schlick's Fresnel term is fixed to 1.5 to resemble a glass-like dielectric coating.

\begin{eqnarray}
F_c(\theta) &=& 0.04 + 0.96 \ (1 - \cos\theta)^5
\end{eqnarray}

### Parameters

As shown in Table [clearcoat-parameters], the clearcoat is parametrized via two scalar values and a normal.

 Name          | Type          | Default | Range  | Description
---------------|---------------|---------|--------|-------------
$c$            | float         | 0       | 0-1    | Clearcoat reflectivity (0 = no clearcoat, 1 = full clearcoat).
$\alpha_c$     | float         | 0       | 0-1    | Roughness of clearcoat's microfacet distribution.
$\mathbf{n}_c$ | float3        | (0,0,1) | $\lVert\mathbf{n}_c\rVert=1$ | Clearcoat normal for normal mapping.
[Table [clearcoat-parameters]: List of clearcoat parameters.]

![Figure [clearcoat-parameters-fig]: Result for various values of clearcoat parameters.](img/params_clearcoat.png)

Cut-out
-------

The cut-out acts like an alpha channel for the surface. It makes parts of the surface transparent, independent of Fresnel terms, view and light direction or any parameters.

### Parameters

 Name          | Type          | Default | Range  | Description
---------------|---------------|---------|--------|-------------
$\nu$          | float         | 0       | 0-1    | Cut-out opacity value (0 = transparent, 1 = opaque).
[Table [cutout-parameters]: List of cut-out parameters.]

![Figure [cutout-parameters-fig]: Result for various values of cut-out parameters.](img/params_cutout.png)

The cut-out parameter is primarily used in conjunction with textures to fake details in geometry, see Figure [cutout-geometry].

![Figure [cutout-geometry]: Cut-out texture applied to a sphere.](img/params_cutout_geometry.png)

Emission
--------

In addition to the reflective and transmissive components, the material contains an emissive component that turns surfaces into diffuse area lights. Light is emitted into the upper hemisphere with regard to the normal.

\begin{eqnarray}
L_e(v) =
\begin{cases}
\rho_e & \text{if } (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}) > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

$\rho_e$ is luminance given in $\frac{\text{lm}}{\text{m}^2 \text{ sr}}$. It is computed from the parameters given in the following table.

### Parameters

 Name          | Type          | Default | Range  | Description
---------------|---------------|---------|--------|-------------
$l_c$          | color         | 1       | 0-inf  | Emission color.
$l_v$          | uniform float | 0       | 0-inf  | Emission value in $\frac{\text{lm}}{\text{m}^2}$ (relative power leaving the object per surface area) or $\text{lm}$ (absolute power leaving the object).
$l_\text{norm}$| uniform bool  | false   |        | Normalize emission color.
[Table [emission-parameters]: List of emission parameters.]

![Figure [emission-parameters-fig]: Result for various values of emission parameters.](img/params_emission.png)

Lights are defined in photometric units. This means, the energy is spectrally weighted with the response curve of the human eye.

The emission is provided as a color $l_c$ and a energy value $l_v$. We expect the color to be in linear sRGB color space with a D65 whitepoint. If the energy normalization flag $l_\text{norm}$ is enabled, the color will be normalized by its luminance. This behavior is needed for physical workflows and it guarantees that the light exactly emits the specified value in its respective physical unit.

The following equations show how to compute $\rho_e$ from these parameters. $\text{area}$ denotes the area of the entire surface of an object in square meters.

\begin{eqnarray}
l = &
\begin{cases}
l_v l_c & \text{if } l_\text{norm}\text{ is false} \\
l_v \frac{l_c}{l_c \cdot \begin{pmatrix}0.2126729 \\ 0.7151522 \\ 0.0721750\end{pmatrix}} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \\
\rho_e = &
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\pi \text{ area}} l & \text{if } l_v \text{ is given in lm} \\
\frac{1}{\pi} l & \text{if } l_v \text{ is given in } \frac{\text{lm}}{\text{m}^2}
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

Volume
------

If the material is configured to behave as a volume boundary, i.e., if the thin-walled flag is set to false, light rays may enter the volume below the surface, scatter and eventually leave at another place. This process is called subsurface scattering and it is controlled by the absorption coefficient $\sigma_a$ and the scattering coefficient $\sigma_s$. Both coefficients are wavelength-dependent values in range $0..\inf$. As this is hard to parametrize for users, we first map from more user-friendly attenuation color $a$ and attenuation distance $d$ to the mean free path length $\text{mfp}$ (or its inverse, the attenuation or extinction coefficient $\sigma_t$), and from subsurface color $\rho_{ms}$ to the single-scattering albedo $\rho_{ss}$ [#KC17].

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_t &=& \frac{1}{\text{mfp}} = \frac{-\log(a)}{d} \\
\rho_{ss} &=& 1 - \left(4.09712 + 4.20863\rho_{ms} - \sqrt{9.59217 + 41.6808\rho_{ms} + 17.7126\rho_{ms}^2}\right)^2
\end{eqnarray}

From this we derive the absorption and scattering coefficient.

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_a &=& \frac{1 - \rho_{ss}}{\text{mfp}} = \sigma_t (1 - \rho_{ss}) \\
\sigma_s &=& \frac{\rho_{ss}}{\text{mfp}} = \sigma_t\rho_{ss} = \sigma_t - \sigma_a
\end{eqnarray}

Intuitively, the mean free path length describes the reciprocal of the density of the medium. The denser the medium, the shorter the distance until a particle is hit and, therefore, the more light is absorbed or scattered out. In our case, after the light traveled $d$ units into the medium, all that remains is the color $a$.

When a particle is hit, the light color gets multiplied by the single-scattering color $\rho_{ss}$. On the surface, the color $\rho_{ms}$ can be observed from the multiple scattering events occuring in the medium.

### Parameters

 Name          | Type          | Default | Range  | Description
---------------|---------------|---------|--------|-------------
$a$            | uniform color | 1       | 0-1    | Attenuation color.
$d$            | uniform float | inf     | 0-inf  | Attenuation distance. A value of 0 will make to surface opaque.
$\rho_{ms}$    | uniform color | 0       | 0-1    | Subsurface color. Subsurface scattering is disabled if $\rho_{ms}=0$.

Design Rationale
================

The Enterprise PBR Shading Model is the basis for a large variety of use-cases, ranging from high-performance VR applications to high-quality offline GI renderings. However, it is not expected that it will cover all use-cases one can imagine, but it should be sufficient for day-to-day use. This requires some tradeoffs, which are based on the following guidelines and requirements.

Most important, the material should be *easy to use* for inexperienced users, but still powerful enough for trained artists in real-time rendering and global illumination. For this reason, the material has only a small amount parameters, following industry-standard workflows known from real-time engines (Unreal Engine 4, Unity Engine) and movie production (Disney BRDF). Using the *metallic/roughness workflow*, it is possible to create a wide varietey of materials from just a very small subset of the whole parameter set, namely albedo, metallic, roughness and normal map. Another aspect of this is the fact that it allows users to parametrize materials in a way that they are *physically-based as a default*, but can be tweaked when needed for more artistic freedom, for example via the specular tint and specular parameters. Wherever possible, the parameters are linear and texturable, so that *layering via parameter blending* is possible. Notable exceptions are parameters affecting the volume, because there are no texture coordinates available inside an object.

Especially for GI renderers, there are certain physical and mathematical properties that materials or BSDFs must fullfill. A BSDF must obey *Helmholtz reciprocity* (for bidirectional rendering methods), be *positive* and *energy conserving* (for fast convergence).

*Performance in real-time rendering* is a critical aspect. Most parameters do not influence each other or have a clearly defined state in which an effect is disbabled, making it possible to specialize shader code for certain use-cases. Clearly, offline GI rendering also profits from this, but besides that it is also important to choose BSDFs that can be *sampled efficiently*, like the GGX microfacet model.

As many software packages offer a unified interface to different renderers, *consistency across renderers* and rendering-algorithms is another key requirement for the material. A material prepared in one renderer, for example in GI, should look the same in other renderers, for example in a rasterizer. As this is not always possible, because some effects like refraction or brute-force subsurface scattering are impossible in a real-time rasterizer, the *rasterizers will approximate* the *ground-truth GI solution*. The material is defined in a way that it encourages approximations wherever possible.

Not all real-world effects can be rendered with the Enterprise PBR Shading Model. Especially for high-quality renderings or light simulation, artists and engineers need more flexbility. Other material systems like [Open Shading Language (OSL)](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage) from Imageworks or [Material Definition Language (MDL)](http://mdlhandbook.com/) from NVIDIA allow users to build their own materials from basic building blocks structured as a node graph. The [Appearance Exchange Format (AxF)](https://www.xrite.com/axf) from X-Rite stores results from a capturing process using their material scanners. Such material systems and models are projected onto the parameters of the Enterprise PBR Shading Model via *fitting* (or *distilling*).

Energy Compensation: Diffuse-Specular
-------------------------------------

Figure [energycomp-plastic_furnace] shows an overview of several methods that can be used to combine diffuse and specular components. We use method $f_4$.

\begin{eqnarray}
f_1(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \frac{1}{\pi} &+& M_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) F(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{h}_r) \\
f_2(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \frac{1}{\pi} (1 - F(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l})) &+& M_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) F(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{h}_r) \\
f_3(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& \frac{1}{\pi} (1 - F(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{v})) &+& M_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) F(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{h}_r) \\
f_4(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) &=& B(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{l}) &+& M_r(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l}) F(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{h}_r) \\
\end{eqnarray}

![Figure [energycomp-plastic_furnace]: Four different methods $f_1 ... f_4$ to combine diffuse (Lambert) and specular (microfacet reflection) component for roughness 0 (top row) and 1 (bottom row). $f_1$ is not energy-conserving, at grazing angles and for multiple bounces the white furnace test fails. The same happens for $f_2$ if roughness is 0. $f_3$, on the other hand, is not energy-preserving, resulting in darkness at grazing angles. $f_4$ is energy-conserving and (almost) energy-preserving. The slight darkening at grazing angles comes from the imperfect approximations we use for performance reasons. This becomes worse for multiple bounces.](img/energycomp_plastic_furnace.png)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
triplanar_mapping = function(float3 pos, float3 p_ddx, float3 p_ddy, float3 normal, float scale) {
	if (abs(n.x) >= abs(n.y) && abs(n.x) >= abs(n.z)) {
    uv = float2(-p.z,-p.y);
    uv_ddx = float2(-p_ddx.z, -p_ddx.y);
    uv_ddy = float2(-p_ddy.z, -p_ddy.y);
  } else if (abs(n.y) >= abs(n.z)) {
    uv = float2(p.x, p.z);
    uv_ddx = float2(p_ddx.x, p_ddx.z);
    uv_ddy = float2(p_ddy.x, p_ddy.z);
  } else {
    uv = float2(p.x,-p.y);
    uv_ddx = float2(p_ddx.x, -p_ddx.y);
    uv_ddy = float2(p_ddy.x, -p_ddy.y);
  }
  return (fract(float2(scale) * uv)
         ,float2(scale) * uv_ddx
         ,float2(scale) * uv_ddy );
};
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The triplanar mapping takes the normal (in world coordinates) and the shading point position as parameters. It also takes the derivatives of the shading point with respect to camera image pixel coordinates. In a GI renderer usually the pixel footprint is computed by starting from a camera ray with differentials of pixel width/height for the camera ray origin, which is then propagated forward through AutoDiff computation rules through the shading point interpolation code to get a shading point with differentials included. In glsl (or similaraly for rasterizers in general) one would use `float3 p_ddx = dFdx(pos);`, `float3 p_ddy = dFdy(pos);` to compute them.

The reason to do the `dFdx` computation on the shading point instead of the uv coordinates after triplanar mapping is, that the shading point is continuous, which produces correct differentials over the whole surface, whereas if we did it after the triplanar mapping (and the wrapping of `u`/`v` coordinates through `fract`) we would need special case handling for the borders of uv space or live with border artifacts because of discontinuities in the differentials.

### GI Implementation details

For a GI implementation it's advisable to have some form of caching of the generated flakes in the footprint. This allows for efficient sampling of the BRDF. In principle smooth microfacet BRDF sampling also works but is not efficient.

### IBL in Rasterizer

We use preconvolved IBL lighting in rasterizer which requires only one environment texture lookup. Handling flake reflections under environment lighting in a stable way is a hard problem because individual flakes have different directions which means that the pixel BRDF lobe can have a very difficult shape. Taking multiple samples in order to sample the BRDF lobe is too costly and might still give some flickering artifacts so instead we decided to keep the naive preconvolved IBL method which does only one environment texture lookup in the main direction of the BRDF lobe and we handle all flakes inside the BRDF evaluation. This gives very stable and smooth results during animations and still remains fast. The limitation of this method is that it doesn't account for light which contributes from the side of the BRDF so it doesn't have a strong glittering effect. Artists can still achieve strong glittering effects and stable flake appearance if they combine IBL with directional light(s).
